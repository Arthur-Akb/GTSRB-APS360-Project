## Abstract

We propose to train a deep learning algorithm to classify traffic signage, a problem which is highly relevant for computer vision in vehicles. Classification is to be accomplished using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), measured against a baseline Artificial Neural Network (ANN), with potential to explore applications of auto-encoders to detect unlabelled features in the data. Preliminary ethical considerations are discussed, with particular attention to the implications for self-driving vehicles.
